🏠 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression | Internship Project
📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate skills in predictive analytics using machine learning. The goal was to build a regression model that can predict house prices based on several input features that commonly affect real estate value.

The model was trained using a synthetically generated dataset that simulates real-world housing data with fields such as:

   House Age

  Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms

  Square Footage

  Lot Size

  Number of Floors

  Garage Availability

The project includes full model training, evaluation, and visual insights.
🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

  Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

  Python – Programming language

  Pandas – Data handling and manipulation

  NumPy – Numerical operations

  Scikit-Learn – Model building and evaluation

  Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization

🛠️ Key Tasks
✅ Dataset Generation

  Simulated realistic housing data using NumPy

  Included features like House Age, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Footage, Lot Size, Floors, and Garage

✅ Data Exploration & Visualization

  head(), describe() for initial data inspection

  Correlation Heatmap

  Pairplot showing feature relationships

  Price distribution using histograms

   Bar plot showing average price by number of bedrooms

✅ Model Building

  Multiple Linear Regression using sklearn

  Train/test split (80/20)

   Fitting the model to training data


✅ Model Evaluation

  R² Score (explained variance)

  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

  Mean Squared Error (MSE)

  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

✅ User Interaction & Prediction

  User prompted to enter housing features

  Model returns predicted price based on user input

📊 Visualizations Included

    🔥 Correlation heatmap of all features

    📈 Pairplot for multivariate relationships

    📉 Histogram of house price distribution

    🏠 Bar plot of average price vs. number of bedrooms

📈 Real-World Applications

This type of regression-based housing price prediction is used in:

  Real Estate Platforms – Price estimation tools for buyers and sellers

  Banking & Mortgages – Automated loan approval based on property valuation

  Urban Planning – Understanding property trends by location

  AI-Powered Investment Tools – Predicting real estate market values

✅ Final Deliverable

A fully-commented, professional Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook containing:

  Synthetic dataset creation
